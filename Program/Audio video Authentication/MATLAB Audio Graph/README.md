# MATLAB Audio Graph

A set of MATLAB programs that produces Graphical representations of a given Audio file.

## Using the Program

1. This folder consists of three programs.

    - **Audioplot.m**: Produces a simple audio wave graph
    - **Histogram.m**: Produces a [Histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram)
    - **Spectogram.m**: Produces a [Spectogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram)

2. Run either of the three programs using MATLAB. (This project was created using MATLAB Version R2021a)

3. Each function takes an Audio File as input in the function `audioread()`.
3. The file to be opened can be changed in the MATLAB `.m` file itself.

4. The main function in the code will then give the corresponding graph as output.

5. The Graph can then be saved from the top-left corner of the screen for further use.
